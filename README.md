# Introduction

Gen42 leverages the Bittensor network to provide decentralized code generation services. Our focus is on creating robust, scalable tools for code-based Q&A and code completion, powered by open-source large language models.

### Products

#### Chat App

We provide a chat frontend that allows users to interact with our subnet. The primary offering of this app is code-based QnA.

#### Code Completion
<!-- 
Code completion has exploded in recent years, tools like [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) are extremely popular but lack in some manners.  -->

<!-- Our subnet aims to compete with Copilot by offering code completion hosted on Bittensor through [Continue.dev](https://continue.dev/). Unlike Copilot we will not be relying on OpenAI. Our miners will be running open-source code-focused LLMs which have proven to be faster and smarter than the product Copilot uses (GPT Codex).  -->

<!-- With an unoptimized miner we have already found that  -->

We provide an openai compliant api capable of being utilized with [continue.dev](https://continue.dev/). For information on getting started visit [Gen42](www.gen42.ai).
